:notebook_with_decorative_cover: Your brand new way to get and dispense books.
Powered by [Angular](https://angular.io/) to build up the UI, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to manage continuous integration and [Firebase tools](https://firebase.google.com/) for [data storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/database/), [hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting/) and [authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/), Booktionator helps you to propagate culture the way you prefer. You can sell, trade and even auction your ~once~ beloved books as well as buy, bid and take part on one's trade.

This is a nonprofit project and was done just for the academic purpose in mind.
